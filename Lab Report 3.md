1.

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).

2. An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).

3. The symptom, as the output of running the two tests above (provide it as a screenshot -- one test should pass, one test should fail).

4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown).

5. Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue.
The issue occured due to an incorrect loop condition. The condition `start <= end` was causing an extra iteration, which is not necessary for reversing the array. The corrected version uses `start < end` as the condition, ensuring the loop stops when the start index crosses the end index. This adjustment successfully reverses the array elements.
